Most of the codes in Verilog must be inside of modules.
	module module_name(port_lists);
	endmodule

Port_lists can be empty.
	module module_name;
	endmodule

Comments can be written in two ways.
	//single line comments  
	/*multiple
	lines
	comments
	*/

Multiple line comments can't be nested.
	/*
		/*
			Not possile
		*/
	*/

Single line comments can't be double slashed multiple times.	//This is a comment.
	////This is the same comment.
	////////This is also the same comment.

White spaces (spaces, tabs, newlines, formfeed) are ignored.All the following lines are same.
	$display("amir");
	  $display("amir");
   		  $display("amir");

		  $display("amir");

Formfeed is slash f. It indicates printer output.
	$display("\famir");

We need to store contents in containers.
	contents = data
	containers = identifiers

To show the data we must specify it's nature. For string we use %s.

Containers and contents must have the same size.
	reg [4*8:1] name = "amir";

We store data to perform some operation on them.

$display("text")
	Displays texts with a return.

$write("text")
	Displays texts wtihout a return.

$finish
	finish the command
