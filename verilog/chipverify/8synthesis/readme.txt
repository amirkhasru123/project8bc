####Verilog Synthesis
	High-level Verilog code -> lower-level representation of netlists. This netlists can be implemented in FPGA or ASIC.
	FPGA=Field Programmable Gate Array
	ASIC=Application Specific IC

	Verilog defines what your circuit does.
	Verilog doesnâ€™t say anything about how fast your circuit should run or what the clock frequency is. To do so we need SCF (usually SDC).
