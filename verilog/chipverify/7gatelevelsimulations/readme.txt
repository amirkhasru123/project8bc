####Gate Level Simulations
	RTL = checks the design’s behavior at a high level (before synthesis). Example: assign x=a&b;
	GLS = verifies the design after synthesis to ensure that synthesis hasn’t introduced any bugs, that the netlist matches the intended functionality, and that timing constraints are met. Example and(x,a,b)

##Implementation
	dff.v //d-flipflop
